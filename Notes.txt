C# Compiler Installation:

Since I am on a Mac I had to run the following command in the terminal:
	brew install mono

I created a hello.exe in vi:

using System;
public class HelloWorld
{
    static public void Main ()
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Hello Mono World");
    }
}

Then I saved the file as hello.cs and quitted out of vi.

The next command I ran in the terminal:
	mcs hello.cs
This created the executable mono.exe. I ran the executable by typing:
	mono hello.exe
